# Stock Analysis
This project seeks to demonstrate the effects of efficient coding and show their benefits. Images will be provided which will show the results of the differences between the original script we ended up with after performing analysis on our data

## Data
This project used stock information in two sheets of an Excel file. The data has information on 12 different stocks, including their ticker value, issue dates, opening/closing and adjusted closing price, highest/lowest price, and volume of the stock. The goal of this analysis function is to get the ticker, the ticker's total daily volume, and the return percentage on each stock.

## Refactored code
